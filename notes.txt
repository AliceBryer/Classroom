Define:

- Web browser = software
- URL = uniform resource locater
- API = application programming interface
- Chrome's web API =  browser API's - console.log for example
- DOM = document object model

Can pull up the webpages HTML 
console.log(window.document);
console.log(document) 

This would give us all the div's, can do it for other elements such as img
document.querySelectorAll('div')

document.querySelector('h2') - This would give us the first h2 it comes across in the document

Using the query selector you need to use the css syntax you would in css to target the elements

document.querySelector('.class-title')
document.querySelector(#id-name)

Javascript styling will take precedence over the HTML styling as JS script link is at the bottom of the HTML.
